									<p>Hey, my name is <i><b>Kushal Barot</b></i>, and I live in Kalol. I am a dedicated and creative professional with a strong academic background and practical experience in data science and database management. My journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications from GLS University, where I designed databases and developed an eCommerce website project, laying a solid foundation in SQL database design and management. My academic achievements, including a commendable CGPA of 7.8, reflect my commitment to excellence and continuous learning.</p>

									<p>Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at DAIICT (Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology), where I have achieved a CGPA of 7.3 in my second semester. During my Master's program, I have delved into advanced topics such as federated learning, implementing a research paper that demonstrates my ability to engage with cutting-edge methodologies in machine learning. My hands-on experience includes developing end-to-end machine learning applications, conducting deep dive analyses on large datasets, and designing a comprehensive database for hospital management.</p>

									<p>In addition to my technical skills, I possess a foundational understanding of MLOps and have conducted extensive data scraping, collection, storage, and cleaning processes. These experiences have honed my analytical abilities and equipped me with the skills necessary to extract valuable insights from complex datasets, informing data-driven decisions. My proactive approach to problem-solving and my eagerness to address real-world challenges underscore my readiness to contribute effectively in a data science or SQL development role.</p>

									<p>Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I am passionate about staying active and enjoying the outdoors. My hobbies include hiking, cycling, and skipping ropes, which keep me physically fit and energized. I also enjoy working on new end-to-end projects, constantly seeking opportunities to innovate and apply my skills in practical applications. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have consistently demonstrated a commitment to excellence, creativity, and continuous improvement. I am excited to leverage my skills and experiences to make meaningful contributions in the field of data science and database management, driving innovative solutions and supporting organizational goals.</p>
